### If there was more time, what would be added?

  I would like to redo the graph plugin, I had a bunch of issues getting it to 
  work properly, I orignally wanted 2 concentric donut graphs to show the user
  what % of there exisiting portfolio looks like so they could visually compare
  both the recommended and their own distribution.

  I would like to rework the input form to be a bit more dynamic, there are a
  few areas in the app where the catagories are hard coded. I would like to change
  these to being dynamically generated from an outside source. 

  I would like to keep working on the CSS, it is passible but it isnt exactly
  what I wanted it to be. I think I could really give it a better impact if I had 
  a little bit more time.

  I would like to refactor the comparison algorithm as it is currently quite large. 
  I wanted to make sure I kept track of what items each section was working on so
  it ended up with some extra variables and some extra functional work.
